# BIOS.pkl
This repositorie represents my research work during my internship at the Institute of Mathematics of Toulouse.
The codes are based on Laurent RISSER's code :

Used to work on pictures, I have adapted the code to the Dataset BIOS.pkl

My goal is to show the existence of a gender bias and to try to remove it. 

### Bias detection 

The purpose of this notebook is to show the existence of a gender bias. This code create a bag of words, one of the NLP representations, with the data of the BIOS.pkl dataset. The data with and without gender indicators will be compared. 

### reglog_pytorch

This notebook creat a neural network.

### W2reg_BIOS

Looks at the effects when changing the regularisation.
